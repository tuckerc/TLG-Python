# FLOWCHART CHALLENGE

**Objective:** Choose one of the flowcharts below. Write a script that allows a user to type in input to answer the questions posed by the flowchart. Have the user's answers direct to the next question and so on until the "conclusion" is reached! *For the sake of the challenge, you may not alter the question/answer structure of the flowchart you choose.*

**BONUS 1-** Your script includes a *Press q to quit* feature which can be used at any time.

**BONUS 2-** Your script controls for human error and repeats the question if the wrong answer is entered.

#### Example Output:
    Basic Engineering!
    ==================
    Does it move?
    > No.
    Should it?
    > Yes.
    Spray some WD-40 on it.

Same script, different result:

    Basic Engineering!
    ==================
    Does it move?
    > Yes.
    Should it?
    > No.
    Wrap it up in duct tape!
